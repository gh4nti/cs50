## 🧠 About

This repository contains my **personal code, notes, and experiments** from **Harvard University's [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science 2021](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021)**.

> I created this repo to track my learning, revisit old problem sets, and document my progress as I explore computer science fundamentals — from low-level C programming to web development with Python, Flask, and SQL.
